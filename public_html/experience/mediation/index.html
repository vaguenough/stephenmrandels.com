<h3 class="section">Dispute Resolution Experience and Training</h3>
<p class="lead paragraph">After working as a litigator for 30 years, Steve Randels was selected to manage the mediation program at the Seattle District Office of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 1999.  The EEOC created and fully staffed Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Units in each of its district offices across the country that year.  After nine years of exceeding the Commission&rsquo;s goals and expectations for the Seattle office&rsquo;s ADR program, Steve left the EEOC in 2007 and established a private mediation practice.  In 2009, he contracted with the Phoenix, Los Angeles, and San Francisco District Offices of the EEOC to conduct mediations in twelve states.</p>
<p>As the <strong>ADR Program Coordinator</strong> for the EEOC&rsquo;s Seattle Office, Steve&rsquo;s responsibilities included:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Selecting, supervising and training over three dozen staff, contractor, and volunteer mediators.</li>
    <li>Mediating over 350 disputes in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho with an 85% resolution rate.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Achieving the following program results:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>2037 mediations</li>
    <li>75% resolution rate for all mediators (exceeding the EEOC&rsquo;s national average of 68.2%)</li>
    <li>Total settlements of $24,586,393</li>
</ul>
<p>At a meeting on November 5, 2007, the EEOC&rsquo;s Commissioners adopted a resolution honoring his career, stating in part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="testimonial">Stephen M. Randels served with distinction as the ADR Coordinator &hellip; during which the Seattle office exceeded its goals for successful mediations, resulting in settlements that promptly resolved many cases &hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to his private practice and work with the EEOC, his experience includes the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Member of the Seattle Federal Executive Board&rsquo;s ADR Consortium, a pool of mediators providing <em>pro bono</em> dispute resolution services for federal, state and local government agencies in the Seattle area.</li>
    <li>Trainer of and lead mediator with students participating in the mediation clinics of University of Washington and Seattle University Schools of Law.</li>
