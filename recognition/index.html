<h3 class="section">Observations of participants in mediations conducted by Steve Randels</h3>
<blockquote>
<p class="testimonial">I was greatly impressed by Steve&rsquo;s performance. In my view as an attorney for some 23 years, he has clearly set the bar by which all mediators are to be measured.</p>
<p class="testimonial">This was a very difficult, emotional case. The mediator, Steve Randels, never gave up on coming up with solutions/suggestions to resolve the differences between the parties. His presentation, creativity and credibility made resolution, beneficent to both parties, possible. He did a great job.</p>
<p class="testimonial">&hellip; Steve Randels achieved a remarkable result as a mediator in this matter.  He worked extremely hard in helping the parties not only to settle their differences but to appreciate each others&rsquo; positions to the point where the employer agreed to conduct a thorough review and analysis of its past and present EEO policies and practices.  As a result, my clients agreed to moderate their economic demands so that a settlement could be reached.  Mr. Randels clearly articulated the parties&rsquo; respective positions after patiently and thoroughly eliciting the subtleties of the relationship.  While, of course, I was only privy to what went on with my clients, it is easy to extrapolate that Mr. Randels garnered the respect of all the parties.  I should add that we did not conclude until after 6:30p.m., having started at 9:00a.m., not an inconsiderable amount of &ldquo;volunteer&rdquo; time on [his] part&hellip;</p>
<p class="testimonial">Stephen Randels is an excellent mediator and helped settle a case that most mediators would have given up on.   Thank you.</p>
<p class="testimonial">Steve Randels is an excellent mediator.  Please give him a raise and some paid time off!!!!</p>
<p class="testimonial">This mediation process was an excellent experience. Stephen Randels&rsquo; experience &hellip; helped tremendously in reaching a settlement.</p>
<p class="testimonial">Stephen Randels did a great job and had incredible patience in the process.</p>
<p class="testimonial">I appreciated Steve Randels demeanor, his seemingly genuine concern for the parties.  He understood the strengths/weakness of the &hellip; party&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p class="testimonial">Steve Randels was extremely helpful throughout the process.  He allowed the mediation to run smoothly and was an excellent facilitator for the mediation.  The process was much easier and less painful than expected!</p>
<p class="testimonial">The mediator, Steve Randels, is great in bringing the parties from [a] big disparity to a resolution.  Good job to him!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="testimonial">Steve Randels did an excellent job communicating between the parties and allowing the process to run smoothly.  He had a great understanding of both sides/issues which made it easy for the parties to communicate.</p>
<p class="testimonial">Very skillful mediator. A pleasure to work with.</p>
<p class="testimonial">Randels knows our business and is almost always successful in resolving claims against the bank.</p>
<p class="testimonial">Mr. Randels was very effective, much more so than other agency mediators I have used in the past.  My client and I were very favorably impressed by him.</p>
<p class="testimonial">Mediator did an excellent job.</p>
